Game ideas / Brainstorming

Have gold and manage resources

Mange against random elements - famine or feed knights (farmers), attacks (knights) (combine strength), buildings (more homes, increase population)

Or player is a monster like a dragon, game based around picking fights and risking health Vs damage done to humans with points on damage done

Have Kingdom & Empire, allow empire to be bigger than kingdom

Stick with basics of project, focus less on gameplay & more on demo of OO in Java by creating a Knight in a Fort in a Kingdom.
Show off other tools software engineer related things like creating UUIDs, Unit tests & showing JavaDoc
